**Only guidance not auto-pilot (yet)**

**Only CUI not GUI**

**Only straight line not curve** 

But

**Any Tablet/Smartphone(windows,android,iOS..)　can use,** because it's used only VNC(Virtual Network Computing)Viewer and 3G/LTE tethering.Everything is calculated on Raspberry Pi.

**No USB port need.You can use for charge**

and

**Software costs are free
